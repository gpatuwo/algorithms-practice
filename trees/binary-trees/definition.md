# Binary Tree

## Definitions
- **search path**: sequence from root to node
- **ancestor**: if a node lies in a node's search path
- **descendant**: if node has an ancestor (also, descendant of itself)
- **depth**: number of nodes in search path
- **height**: max number depth of tree
- **level**: all nodes on same depth in tree

## Types of B-trees
- **full binary tree**: every node other than the leaves have 2 nodes
- **perfect binary tree**: full tree where all the leaves are on the same level (sometimes called complete binary tree)
- **complete binary tree**: like perfect btree but don't care about last level and all nodes are as far left as possible
